      <p>Cardrona is the place known to be the home of the top teir, the world class athletes. They are home to the multiple X Games medalists such as the Wells family which are local and have skied at Cardrona since they were young. Cardona hosts the X Games for New Zealand when it comes aroudn to us and they get to accomidate all the top tier athletes, so if it's on your radar to meet or be with some top tier athletes, Cardrona is the place for you. Otherwise Cardrona is an excellent mountain as it shows us the varse amount of activites avaliable within such a small looking mountain as upon arrival of the mountain, you can see the 2 chairlifts but once exploring the whole mountain or being advised of the map, you would find out that to the right of the base building there are more runs and lifts hidden around the corner! so feel free to go explore around on those trails whenever you come up to play! We are also avaliable during the summer season as we are home to some amazing bike trails and we have held multiple competitions for the downhill and mountain bike enthusiasts!</p>
      <p>As apart of our business we supply all of our visitors with free water and the opportunity to explore around our vicinity and go on all sorts of adventures. You can also check out our cafe which is found in our base building and our very own restaurant! Hope you have a great stay!</p>
