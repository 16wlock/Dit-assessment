      <p>The Remarkables is home to the wonderous and snow covered landscape which is covered in different adventures. We supply the ebst of the best snow, as we are the highest lying mountain in the region which allows us to always recieve the largest snow falls and when it snows trust me... we are making our own snow too, with our own snow making system of snow machines pumping out tonnes of snow during the nights in the cold so that when the mountain re-opens in the morning the next day, all of our wonderful visitors can experience the best of the best snow! </p>
      <p>Our mountain is open all year long to anyone which wishes to explore our scenic mountain range. During the summer we have the avaliability to go exploring on foot to all differnt sight seeing areas on the mountain and especially the picture perfect lake at the top... Lake Alta! During the winter we cater to all kinds of winter activities as you can go tubing, snow shoeing and of course skiing and snowboarding! Our mountain is mainly known for the extremely wonderous snow which is almost always the lovely, soft powder! For our skiers and snowboarders we are mainly known for our extreme terrain which gives our riders the different challenging off-piste trails, as we are known for our big mountain trails made to only be explored by the bravest adventures. We also have a huge park made for any kind of ability ranging from huge jumps all the way down to little speed jumps to get you zoomers to have your fun! </p>
